# Content
ACO with RL algorithm integration (Q-learning) 
Genetic with k-means clustering

Applied to symmetric Traveling Salesman Problem

# Repo Structure
the folder:

  - Sequential_ACO contains the sequential ACO implementation, used as an internal reference while developing the parallel algorithm. No results among those produced in the report belongs to such an implementation.

  - genomic contains out implementation of the genomic algorithm, along with the hybrid approach.
  
  - parallel-ACO contains the parallel implementation of Ant Colony Algorithm in Python.
  
  - parallel-AntQ contains the parallel implementation of Ant-Q Algorithm in Python.
  
  - presentation/slides are sections under developement (spoiler alert: should contain the presentation slides!)
  
  - report contains the project repo along with its latex source code.
